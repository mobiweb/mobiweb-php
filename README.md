## Examples

### SMS API
### Send a single SMS

```php
<?php

//Your account username and password
$username = "";
$password = "";

$client = new MobiWeb\Rest\Client($username, $password);

//Submit message
$message = $client->broadcast(
    [[
      "from" => "HelloWorld", //The sender displayed upon the SMS arrival. Can be composed of 2-11 alphanumeric characters (A-z,0-9, ,-,.) or 14 numeric characters (0-9). Special characters are not allowed.
      "to" => ["44xxxxxxxxxx"], //The full international number(s) of the recipient(s) in international E.164 format https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
      "message" => "Hello from MobiWeb!" //The text of the SMS message. If all characters in the message belong to the 3GPP GSM 7-bit GSM 03.38 ASCII character table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_7-bit_default_alphabet_and_extension_table_of_3GPP_TS_23.038_/_GSM_03.38, you can send up to 160 characters in a single SMS. You can send longer messages automatically by setting message parameter with your preffered text. In long SMS (multi-part SMS), each SMS part can be up to 153 characters. Each part costs as 1 SMS. If one or more characters in the message belong to the 16-bit Unicode / UCS-2 character table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16, because of the increased memory requirement for each character, you can send up to 70 characters in a single SMS. In long SMS (multi-part SMS), each SMS part can be up to 67 characters. Each part costs as 1 SMS.

    ]]
  );

//Print message

### Asynchronous SMS API
### Asynchronous SMS Flow
To achieve better performance, messages you send With MobiWeb Asynchronous SMS API are validated and accepted instantly, but processed asynchronously. Once your messages are processed and submitted you will receive Status Notifications regarding the their status. Message Status Notifications are forwarded automatically, to your system / platform. When a message is processed by our SMS API Platform, the status information is immediately forwarded to your specified DLR Callback URL via a POST request (Status Notification Forwarding). After the messages are delivered or have reached their final status, our SMS API Platform immediately forwards the associated Delivery Reports to your specified DLR Callback URL via a POST request (DLR Forwarding).

You can send longer messages automatically by setting message parameter with your preffered text. In long SMS (multi-part SMS), each SMS part can be up to 153 characters. Each part costs as 1 SMS. If one or more characters in the message belong to the 16-bit Unicode / UCS-2 character table https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16, because of the increased memory requirement for each character, you can send up to 70 characters in a single SMS. In long SMS (multi-part SMS), each SMS part can be up to 67 characters. Each part costs as 1 SMS.

### Receive message status notifications and delivery reports

Status notifications of messages processed and elivery reports are forwarded automatically, to the user system / platform. When a message is processed by our SMS API Platform, the status information is immediately forwarded to your specified DLR Callback URL (specified when setting up your Asynch SMS API Account) via a POST request.

```php
<?

//For information about receiving message status notifications and delivery reports please visit https://api.solutions4mobiles.com/asynchronous-sms-api.html#receive_status_notifications

//Get request
$inputJSON = file_get_contents('php://input');

//convert JSON into array
$input= json_decode( $inputJSON, TRUE );

//print data
print_r($input);

//Return successful http code
header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK', true, 200);
// or error
// header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error', true, 500);

?>
```

### Matching message status notifications and delivery reports with messages

Status notifications and delivery reports POST requests transmit the ```message id```, ```reference_code```, ```recipient phone``` and ```message status```.

Due to the asynchronous nature of the SMPP API, message id is not available when you submit a message for processing.

To match and cross-check messages submitted with their status notifications and delivery reports, please set ```reference_code``` when submitting messages and store it, so you can cross-check and match when you receive a notification and delivery report.

Alternatively, if you are not sending multiple messages to the same mobile numbers, you can use the ```recipient number``` to match reports with messages.
